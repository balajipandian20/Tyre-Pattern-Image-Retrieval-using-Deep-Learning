# Tyre Pattern Image Retrieval for Forensic Applications using Deep neural networks
The main objective is to retrieve original tyre image from tyre impression image which left on crime scenes using Deep Learning Algorithms.
Tyre impression image taken from crime scene contains low quality which can be enhanced using Image preprocessing techniques.
After preprocessing, feature extraction techniques is deployed to extract features of the most relevant information available on the image. These
